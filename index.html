            <h3>Why do this?</h3>
            <p>
                After a couple rounds of iteration it's been found that having a standardised method of time input is of benefit for several clients as well as for
                internal time keeping for projects.
                The easiest idea of time input is a simple string input, we can then use that and gain values to be utilized in different systems
            </p>

            <p>
                So first iteration done, what have we learned? That regex within JS works a bit differently looking globally as opposed to first match.
                This is a benefit, it allows a first search to find all matching phrases, then a first match to decompose the phrase into groups which
                we can then use for our actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently the system works with integer and decimal numbers, and for seconds through to weeks. If duplicate keys are used, the result is 
                additive, (i.e 1h2h -> hours:3), if non keys are used they are ignored rather than throwing errors.  
            </p>
